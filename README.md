## About

Dingo is brought to you with ❤️love❤️ by the Wallaby.js team. While working on our 
[Wallaby.js](https://wallabyjs.com/) and [Quokka.js](https://quokkajs.com/) products, 
time after time we found ourselves performing the same steps: find repo for npm package, 
clone repo, install dependencies, and then open in new instance of VS Code. We created 
Dingo to simplify this process and hope that others will also find it useful.
